   * tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'): This creates the output layer with 10 neurons (for classifying 10 digits), using the softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each class.
4. Compile the Model:
   * model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']): This sets up the model for training.
      * optimizer='adam':  Chooses the Adam optimizer for updating the model's weights during training.
      * loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy':  Specifies the loss function used to measure the model's performance.
      * metrics=['accuracy']:  Defines the metric used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

#Create a TensorBoard callback
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='logs')
# Train the model with the callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
•	 Using tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping:
* Preventing Overfitting: This callback allows you to stop training early if the model's performance on a validation set starts to decline.
* Monitoring: It monitors a specified metric (e.g., validation loss) and stops training when it reaches a certain threshold or after a set number of epochs without improvement.
Example:
python
import tensorflow as tf
# Define your model and training process...
# Create an EarlyStopping callback
early_stopping_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
# Train the model with the callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[early_stopping_callback])
•	Custom Callbacks:
* Flexibility: You can create your own custom callbacks to monitor and control the training process based on specific criteria.
* Customization: You can define custom logic to log data, perform actions, or modify the training process based on your needs.
Example:
python
import tensorflow as tf
class CustomCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {logs["loss"]}, Accuracy = {logs["accuracy"]}')
# Define your model and training process...
# Create a custom callback
custom_callback = CustomCallback()
# Train the model with the callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[custom_callback])
These are just a few examples, and you can combine these methods to create a comprehensive monitoring system for your TensorFlow training process.
